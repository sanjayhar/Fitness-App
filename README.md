# Fitness-App

## About the Project

The **Fitness-App** is a simple, client-side web application designed to help users track various aspects of their fitness journey. Developed as part of a DevOps Internship at Zintora Soft, this project serves as a foundational example of a responsive and interactive web application using core web technologies.

This application aims to provide basic fitness utilities, such as a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator, and can be extended to include workout logging, calorie tracking, or progress visualization. Its simplicity makes it easy to understand, modify, and expand upon.

### Built With

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

---

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes for a seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Interactive UI:** Provides a user-friendly interface for input and display.
*   **Client-Side Logic:** All calculations and interactions are handled directly in the browser, requiring no backend.
*   **Modular Code:** `app.js` handles the core logic, keeping `index.html` clean and `style.css` focused on presentation.
*   **Example Functionality:** (Currently includes, or can easily be extended to include) a BMI calculator.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) to run this application. No special software or server setup is required.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sanjayhar/Fitness-App.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Fitness-App
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or by dragging it into an open browser window.

    ```bash
    # On Linux/macOS (example)
    open index.html

    # On Windows (example)
    start index.html
    ```

## Usage

Once you've opened `index.html` in your browser, you will see the user interface of the Fitness-App. Interact with the provided input fields and buttons to utilize its features.

### Example: BMI Calculator

Assuming the `app.js` implements a BMI calculation:

1.  **Enter your height:** Find the input field labeled "Height" (or similar) and enter your height in centimeters or inches.
2.  **Enter your weight:** Find the input field labeled "Weight" (or similar) and enter your weight in kilograms or pounds.
3.  **Click the "Calculate" button:** A button typically labeled "Calculate BMI" or just "Calculate" will trigger the computation.
4.  **View Results:** Your calculated BMI and possibly a corresponding health category (e.g., "Underweight," "Normal weight," "Overweight") will be displayed on the screen.
